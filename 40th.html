			    	<h3>Capture the Disk</h3>
					<p>Starting around dusk we'll be playing Capture the Disk. Like the name suggests, Capture the Disk is a game similar to Capture the Flag, but with a CSH spin. Rules will be explained prior to the start of the game. There will be an info session to teach new players and help old players learn the rule changes that have occurred over the years. The session will be at 7pm in NRH 1250.</p>
					<h3>Plates</h3>
					<p>After Capture the Disk is finished it's time to get plates! Small groups will organize and go to various restaurants. Whether you like Mark's, Nick Tahou's, Steve T, or another place entirely this is the time to undo any kind of remotely healthy exercise Capture the Disk provided.</p>
                    <h3>Messed Up Movie Night (FUMN)</h3>
 		            <p>
 			        Messed Up Movie Night (FUMN) is a gathering of like minded individuals looking for some good, ol' fashioned depraved, disturbing, or sometimes just plain awful, film. A few times a year The Committee descends upon house to screen approximately 10 hours of both feature and short films in one sitting. Some attendees have a skewed view of what the words "Messed Up" means... Messed Up is somewhat subjective... This subjectivity is best illustrated by the diversity of the list below as well as the reactions of the attendees themselves... Often arguments will break out after a particular film is screened between those who thought the film was Messed Up and those who think The Committee has lost it's mind.

							<span class="timeline-date">April 06, 2016</span>
                            
							We've opened the official Slack channel for 40th! For those who aren't familiar with Slack, it's an awesome communication app that we've started using this year as a substitute for IRC. If you have any questions, feel free to mention them on Slack or email our <a href="contact.html" style="color:#B0197E">Chairman</a>.

						<h2>Childcare</h2>
						<p>
							<span class="timeline-date">April 05, 2016</span>
                            We've received a lot of questions recently regarding child care during the formal dinner portion of 40th. We are sad to announce we will be unable to provide child care or recommend a location for use. If there are Rochester local parents who can recommend a babysitting service or local daycare for use to other parents, we will be happy to add links or phone numbers to the 40th website.
                            <br><br>
We apologize for getting this information to all of you late, as we had been hoping we still may be able to locate something. This will be reflected in the post-mortem notes as something to figure out much earlier for 45th (and beyond), as well as to work with actual CSH alumni parents who have experience with places nearby.
If you have any concerns or questions feel free to email the <a href="contact.html" style="color:#B0197E">Chairman</a>.

						<h2>Parking</h2>
						<p>
							<span class="timeline-date">April 04, 2016</span>
                            There is actually no ticketing or towing on campus (for non flagrant parking, so if you park in a handicapped spot or in a fire lane I make no promises). C-Lot, B-Lot and even the "20-minute spots" outside NRH are all fair game both Saturday and Sunday (as well as Friday after 5pm). If you arrive before 5pm on Friday you can get a free 24 hour parking pass for dorm lots (aka C-Lot). See the RIT Parking website for more info on that.
